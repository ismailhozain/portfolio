This is the react template that I created for SPAs. There will eventually be more versions optimized for different kinds of apps that I build. Those have not yet been determined. They will be in different branches once that does occur.


There is a branch for React-based SPAs that can be used for showcasing and rapid fire projects.

* React
* React Router
* Ant Design
* Polished/Styled Components


* `npm install yarn`
* `yarn`
* `yarn start`
* visit http://localhost:3000/
